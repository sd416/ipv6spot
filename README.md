## IPv6Spot Project Overview

- The IPv6Spot project is the culmination of over two years of continuous work, and I am thrilled to share its progress with you. The key focus has been on addressing the challenges associated with handling temporary and multiple IPv6 addresses, which we successfully resolved through the use of MAC addresses. This approach proved to be an ideal solution, operating seamlessly without issues.
- This captive portal project using IPv6 stands as the first of its kind worldwide, and I am delighted to announce that we have managed to overcome all hurdles to ensure that the captive portal operates smoothly with IPv6, all without relying on a DHCP server. This solution is especially beneficial, as certain systems, like Android, do not support DHCP for IPv6.
- I hope this innovation resonates with you and showcases the potential of IPv6 for secure and user-friendly network experiences.
- Some may ask, "Why transition from IPv4 to IPv6?" When using a captive portal with IPv4, it is relatively easy to breach devices via their MAC address and gain internet access by using another person's active session data. However, with IPv6, this is no longer possible.
- **Project start date: 06/2021**
- **📌 important note: The IPv6 addresses used in the source code are for the example only, you must replace them with addresses compatible with the IPv6 standards.**

Research Paper: IPv6Spot - An Innovative IPv6 Captive Portal Solution with Integrated DNS and Proxy Services

Abstract

This paper introduces IPv6Spot, a pioneering captive portal system designed exclusively for IPv6 networks. Developed by Abdulkader Alrezej, IPv6Spot addresses the critical need for effective network access control in IPv6 environments. The system offers comprehensive features such as user authentication, dynamic IP and MAC address management, bandwidth control, usage monitoring, integrated DNS redirection, and custom proxy servers. The inclusion of custom DNS and proxy servers enhances the captive portal functionality by intercepting network requests and guiding unauthenticated users to the login page. This paper provides an in-depth examination of the system's architecture, implementation details, and the innovative approaches employed to manage IPv6 network access effectively.

Introduction

The global transition to IPv6 is necessitated by the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and the growing number of internet-connected devices. Despite this shift, many network management tools and captive portal solutions remain focused on IPv4, leaving a gap in support for IPv6 networks. IPv6Spot fills this gap by providing a fully functional captive portal tailored for IPv6 environments. The system not only controls network access but also integrates custom DNS and proxy servers to enhance user experience and enforce network policies effectively.

Project Overview

IPv6Spot is a Python-based application utilizing the Flask web framework, various Linux networking utilities, a custom DNS server, and proxy servers. Key features of IPv6Spot include:

1. IPv6 Captive Portal with DNS and Proxy Redirection: Redirects unauthenticated users to a login page by intercepting DNS queries and HTTP requests, controlling network access.


2. Secure User Authentication: Implements robust authentication mechanisms with hashed passwords and secure session management.


3. Dynamic IP and MAC Address Management: Automatically detects and manages user devices based on their IPv6 addresses and MAC addresses.


4. Bandwidth Control and Traffic Shaping: Utilizes Linux traffic control (tc) to allocate and limit bandwidth per user.


5. Usage Monitoring and Enforcement: Tracks data usage and session duration, enforcing limits based on predefined user policies.


6. Custom DNS and Proxy Server Integration: Employs DNS and proxy servers to manage network requests, enhancing captive portal functionality.



System Architecture

The architecture of IPv6Spot is modular, comprising several interconnected components that work together to manage network access and enforce policies.

Web Interface

Flask Framework: Manages HTTP requests, user sessions, and renders templates for the web interface.

Templates and Static Files: Provide the user interface elements such as login pages and dashboards.


Networking Layer

IP and MAC Address Management: Utilizes system commands and the ipaddress module to manage IPv6 addresses and associate them with user sessions.

Traffic Control: Implements bandwidth limitations and traffic shaping using the tc command.

Firewall Rules: Uses ip6tables and nftables to enforce network access policies.


Database Layer

SQLite Database: Stores user credentials, session data, IP addresses, and usage statistics.

Schema Management: Ensures the database schema supports all required fields for new features.


Custom DNS Server

DNS Interception: A DNS server built with the dnslib library intercepts DNS queries from clients.

Domain Redirection: Redirects specific DNS queries to the captive portal or blocks them based on the client's authentication status.

IPv4-to-IPv6 Translation: Converts IPv4 addresses to IPv6 format for domains that do not have IPv6 records.


Custom Proxy Servers

HTTP Proxy Server: Intercepts HTTP requests from clients and redirects unauthenticated users to the captive portal.

Network Detection Responses: Provides appropriate responses to network connectivity checks performed by operating systems.


Background Services

Periodic IP Checks: Monitors user activity and enforces policies through background threads.

Usage Data Collection: Continuously updates usage statistics.


Implementation Details

The implementation of IPv6Spot involves integrating Python scripts with system-level networking commands, a custom DNS server, and custom proxy servers.

User Authentication

Credential Security: Uses werkzeug.security for password hashing and verification.

Session Handling: Manages user sessions securely using Flask's session management and secret keys.


IP and MAC Address Management

MAC Address Retrieval: Executes ip -6 nei to map IPv6 addresses to MAC addresses.
